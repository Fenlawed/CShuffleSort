This was just a C program written after my professor mentioned that this was "the worst" sorting algorithm. So I quickly went and wrote it myself, to see just how long it can take.
If you don't know ShuffleSort, know that if the array is greater than 9, on average, it will take a significant amount of time to solve. So enter higher numbers at your own risk.
I implemented it to print what attempt it is on as well as change the color of the print statement every 100000 tries.
